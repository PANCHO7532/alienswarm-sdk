For your convenience, .inc files were generated by me with the latest stock SDK of Alien Swarm so you can compile game_shader_dx9.dll
Please note that d3dx9.lib is not included. You need to get this by installing the DirectX SDK November 2008, then it should compile fine.

If you want to generate the .inc files by yourself using the "official tools":
- Install the Alien Swarm SDK
- Install the DirectX SDK November 2008
- Install Strawberry Perl, and install String::CRC32 using the CPAN client that comes with Strawberry Perl upon install.
- Check and change every variable to suit your needs on buildsdkshaders.bat
- Uncomment dynamic_shaders on buildsdkshaders.bat if you value your time
- Execute buildsdkshaders.bat to generate the .inc files (and the full set of shaders if you didn't uncomment the dynamic_shaders var)

At the end, all your stuff should be on fxctmp9 and vshtmp9 and ready to be compiled.
